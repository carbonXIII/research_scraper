  Gatsby's blog starter
</h1>

Kick off your project with this blog boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

_Have another more specific idea? You may want to check out our vibrant collection of [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the blog starter.

    '''shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
    gatsby new my-blog-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
    '''

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    '''shell
    cd my-blog-starter/
    gatsby develop
    '''

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierrc
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/content`**: This directory will contain all of the blog posts and assets.

2.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

3.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

4.  **`/static`**: This directory contains the static files such as your icon and [robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org/).

5.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

6.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

7.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

8.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

9.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

10. **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

11. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

12. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

13. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

## üéì Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

Creating your own source plugin.

## What this tutorial covers

In this tutorial you'll create your own source plugin. Your plugin will source data from [pixabay.com](https://pixabay.com) allowing you to add Pixabay images to any Gatsby site.

## What is a source plugin?

Source plugins "source" data from remote or local locations into what Gatsby calls [nodes](/docs/node-interface/).

For more background on source plugins, check out [Gatsby's source plugin documentation](/docs/creating-a-source-plugin/)

## Why create a source plugin?

Source plugins convert data from any source into a format that can be processed by Gatsby. Your Gatsby site could use several source plugins to combine data in interesting ways.

If you can't find a plugin for your data source you can create your own.

_**NOTE:** if your data is local i.e. on your file system and part of your site's repo, then you generally don't want to create a new source plugin. Instead you want to use [gatsby-source-filesystem](/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/) which handles reading and watching files for you. You can then use [transformer plugins](/plugins/?=gatsby-transformer) like [gatsby-transformer-yaml](/packages/gatsby-transformer-yaml/) to make queryable data from files._

## How to create a source plugin

### Overview

Your plugin is going to source images from Pixabay. You'll be able to configure your plugin in your site's `gatsby-config.js` file and write GraphQL queries to access your plugin's data.

> **NOTE:** You'll need a Pixabay API key which you can get by [registering for a Pixabay account](https://pixabay.com/en/accounts/register/). Your API key is in the [‚ÄúSearch Images‚Äù section of the Pixabay API docs](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/#api_search_images).

### An example API request

Pixabay's [API documentation](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/#api_search_images) describes how their API works. Here's an example that uses a few options to search for photos:

`https://pixabay.com/api/?q=yellow+flowers&editors_choice=true&pretty=true&key=<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>`

Take the above URL and paste it in to a browser to see Pixabay's response to your query. It gives you a list of photos matching the query "yellow flowers" that have received an Editor's Choice award.

> **NOTE:** You should replace `<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>` with your Pixabay API key.

### Plugin behavior

Your plugin will have the following behavior:

- Accept config options like a Pixabay API key and a search query
- Make an API request using the provided config options
- Convert the data in the API response to Gatsby's node system

### Setup a new Gatsby site

Create a new Gatsby project and change directories into the new project you just created.

'''shell
gatsby new source-tutorial-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
cd source-tutorial-site
'''

You're going to build your plugin as a "local" plugin that only exists for your project. Later on you'll learn how to publish a plugin to [npm](https://npmjs.com) so anyone can use it, but for now create a `plugins` directory and change into that directory:

'''shell
mkdir plugins
cd plugins
'''

### Create a `plugins` folder

The bare essentials of a plugin are a directory named after your plugin, which contains a `package.json` file and a `gatsby-node.js` file:

'''
|-- plugins
    |-- gatsby-source-pixabay
        |-- gatsby-node.js
        |-- package.json
'''

Start by creating the directory and changing into it:

'''shell
mkdir gatsby-source-pixabay
cd gatsby-source-pixabay
'''

### Create a `package.json` file

Now create a `package.json` file, this describes your plugin and any third-party code it might depend on. `npm` has a command to create this file for you. Run:

'''shell
npm init --yes
'''

to create the file using default options.

> **NOTE:** You can omit `--yes` if you'd like to specify the options yourself.

### Add dependencies

You'll use a couple of modules from npm to add some helper functionality. Install them with:

'''shell
npm install node-fetch query-string --save
'''

Open your `package.json` file and you'll see `node-fetch` and `query-string` have been added to a `dependencies` section at the end:

'''json:title=package.json
  "dependencies": {
    "node-fetch": "^2.2.0",
    "query-string": "^6.1.0"
  }
'''

With the setup done, move on to adding the plugin's functionality.

### Create a `gatsby-node.js` file

Create a new file called `gatsby-node.js` in your `gatsby-source-pixabay` directory, and add the following:

'''js:title=gatsby-node.js
const fetch = require("node-fetch")
const queryString = require("query-string")

exports.sourceNodes = (
  { actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest },
  configOptions
) => {
  const { createNode } = actions

  // Gatsby adds a configOption that's not needed for this plugin, delete it
  delete configOptions.plugins

  // plugin code goes here...
  console.log("Testing my plugin", configOptions)
}
'''

### Step by step through your `gatsby-node.js` file

What did you do by adding this code? You started by importing the dependencies that you added earlier (along with one built in dependency):

'''js:title=gatsby-node.js
const fetch = require("node-fetch")
const queryString = require("query-string")
'''

Then you implemented Gatsby's [`sourceNodes` API](/docs/node-apis/#sourceNodes) which Gatsby will run as part of its bootstrap process. Gatsby expects sourceNodes to return either a promise or a callback (3rd parameter). This is important as it tells Gatsby to wait to move on to next stages until your nodes are sourced, ensuring your nodes are created before the schema is generated.

'''js:title=gatsby-node.js
exports.sourceNodes = ({ actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest }, configOptions) => {
'''

You do some initial setup:

'''js:title=gatsby-node.js
const { createNode } = actions

// Gatsby adds a configOption that's not needed for this plugin, delete it
delete configOptions.plugins
'''

And finally add a placeholder message:

'''js:title=gatsby-node.js
// plugin code goes here...
console.log("Testing my plugin", configOptions)
'''

### Add the plugin to your site

The skeleton of your plugin is in place which means you can add it to your project and check your progress so far.

Open `gatsby-config.js` from the root directory of your tutorial site, and add the `gatsby-source-pixabay` plugin:

'''js:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: "Gatsby Default Starter",
  },
  plugins: [
    "gatsby-plugin-react-helmet",
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-source-pixabay",
      options: {
        key: "<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>",
        q: "yellow flowers",
      },
    },
  ],
}
'''

Open a new terminal in the root directory of your tutorial site, then start Gatsby's development mode:

'''shell
gatsby develop
'''

Check the lines after `success on PreBootstrap`, you should see your "Testing my plugin" message along with the `key` from your `gatsby-config.js` file:

'''shell
success onPreBootstrap ‚Äî 0.048 s
‚†Å Testing my plugin { key: '<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>' }
warning The gatsby-source-pixabay plugin has generated no Gatsby nodes. Do you need it?
success source and transform nodes ‚Äî 0.057 s
'''

Note that Gatsby is warning that your plugin doesn't do anything yet. Time to fix that.

### Fetch remote data from Pixabay

Update `gatsby-node.js` in your `plugins/gatsby-source-pixabay/` directory:

'''js:title=gatsby-node.js
const fetch = require("node-fetch")
const queryString = require("query-string")

exports.sourceNodes = (
  { actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest },
  configOptions
) => {
  const { createNode } = actions

  // Gatsby adds a configOption that's not needed for this plugin, delete it
  delete configOptions.plugins

  // highlight-start
  // Convert the options object into a query string
  const apiOptions = queryString.stringify(configOptions)

  // Join apiOptions with the Pixabay API URL
  const apiUrl = `https://pixabay.com/api/?${apiOptions}`

  // Gatsby expects sourceNodes to return a promise
  return (
    // Fetch a response from the apiUrl
    fetch(apiUrl)
      // Parse the response as JSON
      .then(response => response.json())
      // Process the JSON data into a node
      .then(data => {
        // For each query result (or 'hit')
        data.hits.forEach(photo => {
          console.log("Photo data is:", photo)
        })
      })
  )
  // highlight-end
}
'''

You've added code that fetches photo data from the Pixabay API. For now, your plugin logs that data but doesn't do anything else. Check that you can see the logged photo data by restarting `npm run develop`. This time you should see a series of results like:

'''shell
success onPreBootstrap ‚Äî 0.035 s
‚†† source and transform nodesresponse Response { size: 0, timeout: 0 }
Photo data is: { largeImageURL: 'https://pixabay.com/get/ea36b70d29fd073ed1584d05fb1d4e9ee570e4d510ac104497f5c071a3efb6bd_1280.jpg',
  webformatHeight: 426,
  webformatWidth: 640,
  likes: 17,
  imageWidth: 5184,
  id: 3362196,
  user_id: 5598375,
  views: 263,
  comments: 24,
  pageURL: 'https://pixabay.com/en/dandelion-flower-yellow-nature-3362196/',
  imageHeight: 3456,

  ...(more data follows)...
'''

You're ready to add the final step of your plugin - converting this data into a Gatsby node.

### Use `createNode` function

You're adding a helper function on lines 13 to 28 and processing the data into a node on lines 46 to 49:

'''js:title=gatsby-node.js
const fetch = require("node-fetch")
const queryString = require("query-string")

exports.sourceNodes = (
  { actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest },
  configOptions
) => {
  const { createNode } = actions

  // Gatsby adds a configOption that's not needed for this plugin, delete it

  delete configOptions.plugins
  // highlight-start
  // Helper function that processes a photo to match Gatsby's node structure
  const processPhoto = photo => {
    const nodeId = createNodeId(`pixabay-photo-${photo.id}`)
    const nodeContent = JSON.stringify(photo)

    const nodeData = Object.assign({}, photo, {
      id: nodeId,
      parent: null,
      children: [],
      internal: {
        type: `PixabayPhoto`,
        content: nodeContent,
        contentDigest: createContentDigest(photo),
      },
    })

    return nodeData
  }
  // highlight-end

  // Convert the options object into a query string
  const apiOptions = queryString.stringify(configOptions)

  // Join apiOptions with the Pixabay API URL
  const apiUrl = `https://pixabay.com/api/?${apiOptions}`

  // Gatsby expects sourceNodes to return a promise
  return (
    // Fetch a response from the apiUrl
    fetch(apiUrl)
      // Parse the response as JSON
      .then(response => response.json())
      // Process the response data into a node
      .then(data => {
        // For each query result (or 'hit')
        data.hits.forEach(photo => {
          // highlight-start
          // Process the photo data to match the structure of a Gatsby node
          const nodeData = processPhoto(photo)
          // Use Gatsby's createNode helper to create a node from the node data
          createNode(nodeData)
          // highlight-end
        })
      })
  )
}
'''

### Query for results

Your plugin is ready. Restart `npm run develop` and open a browser at [http://localhost:8000/\_\_\_graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql). The Pixabay data can be queried from here. try:

'''graphql
{
  allPixabayPhoto(limit: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        largeImageURL
        pageURL
        tags
        user
      }
    }
  }
}
'''

Or [open the query from this link](<http://localhost:8000/___graphql?query=%7B%0A%20%20allPixabayPhoto(limit%3A%2010)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20edges%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20node%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20largeImageURL%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20pageURL%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20tags%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20user%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D%0A>).

Experiment with different options in your `gatsby-config.js` file to see how that affects your query results. The [Pixabay API docs](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/#api_search_images) might be a useful reference.

## Publishing a plugin

Don't publish this particular plugin to npm or the Gatsby Plugin Library, because it's just a sample plugin for the tutorial. However, if you've built a local plugin for your project, and want to share it with others, `npm` allows you to publish your plugins. Check out the npm docs on [How to Publish & Update a Package](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages) for more info.

> **NOTE:** Once you have published your plugin on `npm`, don't forget to edit your plugin's `package.json` file to include info about your plugin. If you'd like to publish a plugin to the [Gatsby Plugin Library](/plugins/) (please do!), please [follow these steps](/contributing/submit-to-plugin-library/).

## Summary

You've written a local Gatsby plugin that:

- can be configured with an entry in your `gatsby-config.js` file
- requests data from a third-party API
- pulls the API data into Gatsby's node system
- allows the data to be queried with GraphQL

Congratulations!

## Where next?

Your plugin has been adapted from Jason Lengstorf's [gatsby-source-pixabay plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-source-pixabay). Check out [the source on GitHub](https://github.com/jlengstorf/gatsby-source-pixabay).

Try adding new features to your plugin, for example - download images from Pixabay, improve error handling, add documentation or automated tests.

Check out Gatsby's docs on [plugin authoring](/docs/creating-plugins/) and [creating a source plugin](/docs/creating-a-source-plugin/).

### A note on JavaScript versions

In this tutorial you've written code in a version of JavaScript that's compatible with Node.js version 6 and above.

Jason's version of [the plugin](https://github.com/jlengstorf/gatsby-source-pixabay/blob/master/src/gatsby-node.js) uses newer JavaScript features with [babel](https://babeljs.io/) to provide compatibility for older versions of Node.

title: Gatsby‚Äôs Commitments to Diversity and Inclusion (D&I)
date: 2019-08-30
author: Maddie Wolf
excerpt: "An update on the tactical steps we are working on which align with the Gatsby value of You Belong Here"
tags:
  - diversity-and-inclusion
---

You may have seen the [‚ÄúYou Belong Here‚Äù](/blog/2018-09-07-gatsby-values/) phrase used by folks at Gatsby. You may have also thought, ‚ÄúDoes that really include me?‚Äù The answer is **YES**. We want the Gatsby community and developer community at large to not just accept everyone, but actively seek and elevate the voices of those from underrepresented groups.

We‚Äôre so excited to announce the following 5 steps, which are just the beginning of our efforts:

**Investing in the Community**: Gatsby is going to sponsor two interns at [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org). Outreachy provides internships in programming, user experience, documentation, illustration, graphical design, or data science to work in Free and Open Source Software. Internships are open to applicants around the world who face under-representation or systemic bias in the technology industry.

**Gatsby Fellowship Program**: In 2020 we will begin having paid Gatsby fellows sourced from diverse communities, who will receive mentorship and the potential to join the Gatsby team after the completion of their fellowship.

**External Partnerships Fund**: We are committing \$10,000 per year to sponsor events and programs, which help bring individuals from underrepresented groups into the developer community. We will evaluate our contributions every six months.

**Donation Credits**: Previously, individuals who contributed to Gatsby received a credit to our Swag Store to put towards merch. As of today, people have the additional [option of donating the credited amount](https://store.gatsbyjs.org/product/diversity-inclusion-donation) to our External Partnerships Fund (in addition to the \$10,000).

**Code of Conduct**: We have created the [conduct@gatsbyjs.com](mailto:conduct@gatsbyjs.com) alias, which can be used to report any behavior that violates our [Code of Conduct](/contributing/code-of-conduct/) to Gatsby leadership team.

We review our commitments every six months to ensure effectiveness, so we welcome thoughts and ideas about how to make this even better!

title: Images, Files & Video in Gatsby
---

Gatsby provides multiple solutions for adding images, video, and files to your projects. And a pro tip: you don't necessarily have to use GraphQL! From [imports](/docs/importing-assets-into-files/) and use of the [static folder](/docs/static-folder/) to dynamic queries with [Gatsby Image](/docs/using-gatsby-image/) to prevent image bloat, you've got options.

This section will walk you through several common patterns for handling media with Gatsby, where you can learn about the pros and cons of each method.

title: Component-Scoped Styles with CSS Modules
---

Component-scoped CSS allows you to write traditional, portable CSS with minimal side-effects: gone are the worries of selector name collisions or affecting other components' styles.

Gatsby works out of the box with [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules), a popular solution for writing component-scoped CSS. Here is an [example site that uses CSS Modules](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/using-css-modules).

## What is a CSS Module?

Quoting from [the CSS Module homepage](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules):

> A **CSS Module** is a CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default.

CSS Modules let you write styles in CSS files but consume them as JavaScript objects for additional processing and safety. CSS Modules are very popular because they automatically make class and animation names unique so you don't have to worry about selector name collisions.

### CSS Module example

The CSS in a CSS module is no different than normal CSS, but the extension of the file is different to mark that the file will be processed.

'''css:title=src/components/container.module.css
.container {
  margin: 3rem auto;
  max-width: 600px;
}
'''

'''jsx:title=src/components/container.js
import React from "react"
// highlight-next-line
import containerStyles from "./container.module.css"

export default ({ children }) => (
  // highlight-next-line
  <section className={containerStyles.container}>{children}</section>
)
'''

In this example, a CSS module is imported and declared as a JavaScript object called `containerStyles`. Then, a CSS class from that object is referenced in the JSX `className` attribute with `containerStyles.container`, which renders into HTML with dynamic CSS class names like `container-module--container--3MbgH`.

### Enabling user stylesheets with a stable class name

Adding a persistent CSS `className` to your JSX markup along with your CSS Modules code can make it easier for users to take advantage of [User Stylesheets](https://www.viget.com/articles/inline-styles-user-style-sheets-and-accessibility/) for accessibility.

Here's an example where the class name `container` is added to the DOM along with the module's dynamically-created class names:

'''jsx:title=src/components/container.js
import React from "react"
import containerStyles from "./container.module.css"

export default ({ children }) => (
  <section className={`container ${containerStyles.container}`}>
    {children}
  </section>
)
'''

A site user could then write their own CSS styles matching HTML elements with a class name of `.container`, and it wouldn't be affected if the CSS module name or path changed.

## When to use CSS Modules

CSS Modules are highly recommended for those new to building with Gatsby (and React in general) as they allow you to write regular, portable CSS files while gaining
performance benefits like only bundling referenced code.

title: "Gatsby: Why We Write"
date: 2019-04-19
author: Sam Bhagwat
excerpt: "Why does the Gatsby team and community write so much? Six principles that explain our love for writing."
tags: ["gatsby-inc"]
---

If you're a Gatsby community member, you may have noticed something: we write _a lot_.

Community members are often surprised by the comprehensiveness of our [documentation](/docs/). We publish new articles on this blog multiple times per week, from both the core team and the community.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The <a href="https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gatsbyjs</a> docs are some of the best I&#39;ve ever read. Super clear setup instructions, especially Step 0 for those new to dev. Too many other frameworks assume dev environment setup experience, so it&#39;s nice to see the Gatsby team be better here.</p>&mdash; Matt Convente (@mattconvente) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattconvente/status/1099706762897342465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2019</a></blockquote>

Writing isn't something we just do because we love it (although we do). Writing is core to who we are as a project, a company, and a community.

Writing is core to the success we've enjoyed so far, and it's core to our strategy to become the default way to build on the web.

## Principle 1: We write

Some Inkteam members who have been regularly writing (speaking, appearing on podcasts, streaming): [Jason](/contributors/jason-lengstorf/), [Marcy](https://egghead.io/podcasts/heading-gatsby-s-learning-experience-and-bridging-gaps-with-marcy-sutton), [Amberley](/contributors/amberley-romo/), [Linda](/contributors/linda-watkins/), [Dustin](/contributors/dustin-schau/), [Shannon](/contributors/shannon-soper/), [Jim](/contributors/jim-ettig/), [Marisa](/contributors/marisa-morby/), [Preston](/contributors/preston-so/), [Mikhail](/contributors/mikhail-novikov/), [Sid](/contributors/sidhartha-chatterjee/), [Andrew](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/gatsby-days-preview-andrew/), [Mike](/contributors/mike-allanson/), [John](/docs/mdx/), [me](/contributors/sam-bhagwat/), and
[Kyle](/contributors/kyle-mathews/),

And it's not just the Inkteam. The documentation, while curated by the Inkteam, has largely been authored by enthusiastic community members, along with about half of our blog posts.

Off this blog, on Twitter and the wider web, every day brings four or five community members writing about their experience.

Why do we write so much?

The answer:

## Principle 2: content acts as a guide unlocking the power of Gatsby.

Gatsby is so powerful, because of its core _and the ecosystem_ ‚Äî not just plugins and themes, but React, Webpack and Babel, the entire npm ecosystem, and modern JavaScript in general.

You can do almost anything you want with Gatsby, you just have to:

1. _know why & that it's possible_
2. _know how to do it_

Roughly speaking, there are two sides of content at Gatsby ‚Äî marketing content which focuses on (1), and learning content which focuses on (2).

An example of (1) might be Linda's [How To Talk About Gatsby To Your Clients and Team](/blog/2019-03-07-sell-gatsby-to-clients/).

An example of (2) might be Jason's [Learn With Jason](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz8Iz-Fnk_eTpvd49Sa77NiF8Uqq5Iykx) series or really anything in the [docs](/docs/).

There's tons of overlap - _why_ points to _how_, and _how_ points to _why_. You could argue we've spent more time on (2) than (1), but the reality is that _we've only scratched the surface of what's possible_.

## Principle 3: because Gatsby is so powerful, the ground to cover with writing is huge, yet essential

- Marcy's Q2 2019 project is to catalogue the **[Top 25 Workflows](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YJ_4NGwxPqtMo-kyWBmg7NBr_YYZezKZ1phXjl0abD4/edit#slide=id.gcb9a0b074_1_0)** people do with Gatsby and improve the experience for 5-10 of them. You'll notice that many of them are not exclusive to Gatsby, instead they're "what you need to do in order to build a website".

- We identified about 50 key messages relating Gatsby to _high-level benefits_ (such as improving security, reducing cost, simplifying your stack), to _different technologies_ (WordPress, Drupal), _vendors_ (Contentful, AWS), and _communities_(JAMStack, modern development, accessibility). In addition, they cover messages that are important for the wide range of personas in the Gatsby ecosystem -- marketers, educators, open-source contributors, plugin authors, numerous flavors of developers, etc.

Each of these 70-80 messages & workflows probably has ~10 sub-workflows/sub-messages/features ‚Äî imagine for each of these we had 3-5 case studies, docs pages, dedicated tutorials, starters/themes with annotated open-source source code -- that's thousands, probably tens of thousands, of pieces of content. _That's why we've only scratched the surface of what's possible._

Our ideal version of Gatsby is a hyperconnected city ‚Äî connected to all of these somewhat disparate communities (WordPress, Drupal, modern frontend, accessibility), and so on.

People from each of the communities who have discovered Gatsby are the experts on delivering the message of "why Gatsby" to that community.

Our objective is **covering the ground** ‚Äî or if you prefer, _breadth-first search_ rather than _depth-first search_ ‚Äî making sure that each meaningful message has at least some basic material (both documentation of _how_ and the _why_ of case studies and success stories).

In our content database, which lives in Airtable, we store an auto-updating column in the Messages table, which tracks the number of content pieces per message.

But...there's a lot of ground to cover? **Yes, there is.**

It's essential to our mission, though, because in order to become the default choice for building on the web, people need to realize that _Gatsby can do anything you conceivably want_ - this is why WordPress became 30% of the internet! - and we emphasize that by writing about all use cases.

_"Gatsby can't do X"_ gets rebutted by _"Here's a case study of Gatsby doing X"_.

(For more background on this concept, read about ["economies of scope"](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2012/10/15/economies-of-scale-economies-of-scope/) or think about companies that have flourished by providing access to literally everything their customers needed ‚Äî the 1897 Sears Roebuck catalogue had around 73K items; today, Amazon (the "Everything Store") has [100s of millions of items](https://wpengine.com/reduce-reuse-refresh/).)

The challenge, is of course _how do we write all of that content?_

## Principle 4: Leverage ourselves through collaboration.

Some examples:

- We strive to appear on podcasts, because of the huge reward / time effort, as well as because podcasts build on an existing community/listener base.

- We encouraging the community to give conference talks, write on their own blogs, and on the Gatsby blog. Individuals can establish themselves publicly as talented developers and Gatsby experts, while companies using Gatsby can publicly showcase their efforts for both internal and recruiting benefit.

- Jason's livestreams are fundamentally collaborative ‚Äî inviting one person who is an expert in a different technology for cross-pollination.

- We maintain close relationships with educators who create comprehensive, complementary content, and provide encouragement to first-time users that _you can do this!_.

If you're doing interesting, innovative things with Gatsby, especially in a professional context, we'd love you to write blog posts, tutorials, and documentation about what you're doing!

## Principle 5: Content is not just individual pieces of work, it's compilations.

If content were music, it wouldn't consist of just "songs" -- it would also include "playlists", "albums", "discographies", "soundtracks", and "multi-box sets".

On the one hand, there is _so much left to write_. On the other hand, because we've already been writing so much for so long, we have SO MUCH CONTENT that a key challenge becomes organizing that content in useful ways that provide comprehensive treatments of particular topics.

In the docs, things are structured hierarchically, so usually content is mostly adjacent to related content on the left sidebar.

But outside the docs, that's far from the case. We have blog posts, [using-\* example sites / guides](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples), [starters](/starters/), conference talks, podcast appearances, tweets, and whatever Gatsby community members dream up and publish!

**It's a constant challenge to organize these in ways that are useful and obvious for the end-user**. We're always attacking this in five or ten different ways -- discoverability via search, cross-linking, hierarchy, navbars and breadcrumbs, turning conference talks into blog posts and blog posts into docs.

Our goal is to make it easy for the user to gather relevant context, know where to look when they get stuck, and feel confident that they can make it if they keep on reading, learning, and trying.

## Principle 6: make it easy for folks to become engrossed with Gatsby

Building sites with Gatsby is the way of the future. Our goal is to let people dive _as far deep into it as they want, and encourage them by providing them more and more to discover._

We want everyone to build and keep building, read and keep reading.

We want everyone to understand [the depths of Gatsby](/docs/behind-the-scenes/), to hunger and thirst for knowledge, to tell all of their friends and coworkers and significant other all the cool things they are learning and doing with Gatsby until those folks check it out too.

We want folks who build their site with Gatsby; to build a plugin. We want folks who write documentation; to want to contribute code.

We want folks who contribute code to dive deep into Gatsby's core, to the internal plugins where few other than [Michal](https://twitter.com/mipiechowiak) and [Kyle](https://twitter.com/kylemathews) dare to venture.

We want to do this because Gatsby _is_ the future of the web, a place where performance and accessibility don't have to be reinvented site-by-site but can come baked in, where you can author your content wherever and still have an amazing developer experience.

And we want everyone to know about it.

title: Why Impossible Foods Chose Gatsby to Power Their Ecommerce Website Relaunch
date: 2019-09-16
author: Hashim Warren
excerpt: "Impossible Foods needed a website with new functionality, that could withstand surges in traffic. These challenges and requirements led the Impossible Foods team to adopt a Content Mesh approach to their website architecture."
tags:
  - case-studies

---

Impossible Foods‚Äô mission is to restore biodiversity and reduce the impact of climate change by transforming the global food system. The company is doing that by releasing plant-based foods that taste more like beef, chicken, and fish than what consumers have come to expect from traditional meat alternatives.

The Impossible Burger is the breakout offering from the company, and it made a splash last year after Burger King added it to its fast food menu. Suddenly Impossible Foods grew from supplying 100 restaurants to 5000, overnight.

## The Need for a New Website Experience

The first version of the Impossible Foods website was adequate, but as the company grew several problems became evident. Designers and writers struggled with slow turn around times because the website could only be updated by a developer. The site‚Äôs pages and map section were both static, providing no experience to users other than the delivery of flat information.

Impossible Foods needed a website with new functionality, that could withstand surges in traffic as interest and demand for their innovative burgers grew around the world. And the website needed to offer a first-class experience to all stakeholders - from content editors and IT staff, to restaurants and consumers. These challenges and requirements led the Impossible Foods team to adopt a ["Content Mesh"](/blog/2018-10-04-journey-to-the-content-mesh) approach to their website architecture, with Contentful as a [headless CMS](/docs/headless-cms), Shopify for ecommerce, and Gatsby.

## The Content Mesh Approach for Ecommerce

The development team created reusable components in Gatsby and sourced content from ‚Äúmodules‚Äù created within Contentful. They also connected the site to Shopify to power the checkout experience, as well as display in-stock products, descriptions, and prices. Content producers were now free to create and update content on the site, simply by using the editing experience with Contentful and Shopify. This new workflow dramatically reduced the turnaround time for new announcements to be published on the website.

The Impossible Foods team raved that their new architecture enables their content strategy to keep pace with the acceleration of their business.

There's an emerging trend in modern web development called the JAMstack. It's largely being discussed in developer circles, but I was lucky enough to work on a site relaunch project as a marketer where I got to see the JAMstack in action.

It got me excited about the future because I've been in marketing for the best part of a decade and I've never witnessed a site that I've worked on go from zero to hero so quickly. There's often a disjoint in the decision making process when companies with resources (i.e. some money, developers and a marketing team) decide to launch or relaunch a marketing website. So in this post I'm going to summarise:

- What the JAMstack is and what it means for tech-savvy marketers
- An example of a JAMstack site that I worked on
- The pros and cons from a marketing perspective

## What is the JAMstack?

JAM stands for **J**avaScript, **A**PIs, and **M**arkup. If you're interested in learning more about the technical details you can [check out JAMStack.org](https://jamstack.org/), watch ["The Rise of the JAMStack" on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWTMEDEPw8c) and [read about the history of JAMstack](https://snipcart.com/blog/jamstack).

In terms of what this means to you as a marketer ‚Äì it's essentially a modern way to build a website that is static instead of dynamic. This provides you with some very important business benefits: speed, security, stability and scalability. I didn't intend for them all to begin with the letter S, but here we are!

![What is JAMstack](./images/whatisjamstack.jpeg)

Put simply, a JAMstack website has an unlimited ecosystem of all of the tools and services you need in the background, but the actual site itself on the front-end is just HTML.

Building your marketing site on the JAMstack is an efficient and reliable way to combine all of your content and channels and serve it up as a lightning-fast website that your visitors will love. If you need to add ecommerce, paywalls, a podcast or some other content to your site in the future, your team won't have to figure out how to get everything to play ball with your CMS or build a new site from scratch. Instead they'll be able to connect new APIs or services to your existing site.

**The past vs the future**
Using a traditional CMS is more restrictive and opinionated than this. You're constrained to the platform you choose from the get-go and forced to accept additional "features" that you might not even need. While these platforms have provided us with an excellent way to publish websites in the past, it's changing for the future.

<Pullquote>
Thanks to progression with modern browsers, static site generators, APIs and content delivery networks, websites can be built as modular stacks that aren't tied to specific technologies.
</Pullquote>

**Going back to the benefits:** better performance, higher security, cheaper to scale & a better experience. These aren't just developer benefits, they apply directly to the marketing team too. Better performance means better site engagement and improved SEO. Higher security means less chance of not hitting your stretch goal next June because the site got hacked. Cheaper to scale means there will be less roadblocks in your way when you want to add that Shopify store or when a big campaign sends 1M visitors to the site. Better experience ‚Äî who wouldn't want that?

**The rise of static sites**
Static site generators like Gatsby play a huge part in making all of this possible, and there are lots of [exciting new tools](https://www.staticgen.com/) appearing that support the future of publishing on the JAMstack. Static site generators work by pulling content from APIs and running a build task in the background to generate your site. So when your visitors arrive, they‚Äôre met with blazing-fast load times, and your security and SEO is taken care of.

## Enter the headless CMS

So you might be thinking if there's no traditional CMS and your site is pure HTML, that means you have to work on all of your content and SEO directly in code. While this is one way to do it, there is a better way for marketing teams.

Since we're building websites that are modular, it's still possible to use any CMS that has a robust API to send content to your site. Instead of storing all of your content in GitHub, you can pull it right out of a CMS of your choosing and use a static site generator to build a speedy, optimised website.

![Headless CMS](./images/headlesscms.jpeg)

The great thing about this approach is that your developers can bring their preferred stack, while the marketing team benefit from a familiar environment to handle things like content management and SEO. Everyone wins!

## An argument for moving away from plugins

Building a marketing website with well-known platforms that offer plugins, add-ons and other easy wins for marketers seems like a great idea. Sometimes it is a great idea. But too many times have I seen it quickly escalate into a difficult scenario where site performance is seriously lagging and the only real solution is to start over and build something that is suited to your needs, without all of the extra bloat.

Hacked up themes, page builders and plugins for all of the things can wreak havoc with site performance if you have a dynamic site powered by a traditional CMS. This has a knock-on effect on the user experience, SEO and overall effectiveness of your website.

Site performance and site speed is an increasingly important ranking factor. Not only that, all of the top ranking factors these days are related to on-site engagement, which also suffers if you haven't got a site that performs.

**"But WordPress is good for SEO".** OK let's unpack that. In order to get custom meta data, structured data, canonicals, XML sitemaps or AMP you're going to need a series of plugins and possibly some ongoing manual work depending on your requirements. Is this really good enough in 2019? Are we as marketers being lazy and relying on systems which make our jobs easier, but which impede our results?

Using plugins to assist the speed at which you can launch marketing campaigns makes sense. But if the end result is hindered by poor performance and reduced page engagement ‚Äì does it still make sense?

Ditching the concept of the plugin and opting for a JAMstack site which is "just HTML" doesn't actually mean you have to give up functionality, or suddenly need to know how to code like a front-end developer to manage a site and its content. You can still achieve the same results with an ecosystem of tools and services that are tailored specifically for you. Yes it takes some development up-front (let's be real, so does any website) - but the payoff is huge!

## Example: Ghost Docs site performance

![Ghost Documentation](./images/ghostdocs.png)

The site launch that I worked on was for [Ghost Docs](https://docs.ghost.org/). Previously the documentation for Ghost was spread out over several domains, making it difficult to navigate. When it comes to SEO, the docs.ghost.org subdomain had a lot of issues with versioned duplicate content and hundreds of URLs were being excluded:

![Ghost Docs SEO](./images/ghostdocsseo.png)

The project to rebuild this site from the ground up gave us an opportunity to completely turn this around. The smart people that I am fortunate enough to work with decided to use it as an opportunity to put [Ghost on the JAMstack](https://blog.ghost.org/jamstack/). There was also a complete design overhaul, while I worked on restructuring and rewriting lots of the content and improving the meta data across the whole site.

The end result scores incredibly positive site performance reports:

![Website Performance](./images/siteperformance.jpeg)

Since the SEO health of the site was so bad before, it took a few days for Google to care and start re-indexing. I checked and double checked we had all of the redirects in place and assumed we were in for a long wait, but then suddenly things turned around within a week.

In the first month after we launched, impressions in Google were up 44% and clicks were up 12%. By month two, impressions were up 73% and clicks 43%. Beyond this things started to stabilise a little on a MoM basis, but overall things are trending upward, with plenty of new search terms appearing in search console every week.

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

As always, there is still work to do to ensure the site ranks well for the most relevant terms, but right now the work put in upfront to improve the site is paying off handsomely. From a marketers perspective it was really exciting - I've never migrated a site with such instant success before.

**Here's the stack we're using:**

- [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) delivering content via the API
- A front-end built in React with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/) (our static site generator of choice)
- Deployed with [Netlifly](https://netlify.com/) (really nifty content delivery network)
- [Algolia](https://algolia.com/) powering the search functionality
- [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) to automate community feedback into Slack for content improvements

We have also built and contributed an [advanced sitemap plugin](/packages/gatsby-plugin-advanced-sitemap/?=sitemap) which automatically builds a sitemap for any Gatsby project.

Much of the SEO functionality is being pulled directly from Ghost via the API (which has all of the structured data, custom meta data, canonicals etc built-in). This means I can manage most of the content and meta data directly in the Ghost admin client. When I save new changes they're pushed into the static front-end via Netlify ‚Äì it's a fantastic workflow!

![Netlify](./images/netlify.png)

I did also have to work directly with the codebase as some of the content lives in GitHub, which is a decision we made when building the site. I've been writing and deploying marketing content in code since I joined the team and I'm a better technical marketer for it.

## Pros & cons of working with the JAMstack for marketers

My experience of working with the JAMstack was thoroughly enjoyable. Several weeks of work went into the site, and although I wasn't responsible for any of the build, I was able to work closely with the team who was. It was fascinating to see it come together and learn more about how the components of a modern static site actually work.

I've already covered some of the benefits of opting to use JAMstack instead of a traditional CMS/dynamic site ‚Äì but what about the pros and cons of working with this technology as a marketing professional?

**Overall benefits:**

- Improved technical knowledge and skills - including shipping content and working with code every day during the build. End result = easier to manage, improve and optimise the site content after it launched.
- Became well versed in how the site is structured, resulting in greater understanding and communication between teams (dev + design + marketing).
- The development cycle and the content were being worked on simultaneously and you could see the iterative improvements being made instantly. No long dev cycles followed by a mad dash to get all of the marketing content in at the last minute.

**The "downsides":**

- Even if using a [headless CMS](/docs/headless-cms/), there may still be parts of the site that exist entirely in code. So you'll need to get comfortable with editing content and meta data in more than one place.
- Shipping new marketing material might take a little longer compared to relying on well known methods (depends on your stack and your team, though).
- New tech means you might stumble upon some exciting new bugs or issues that can take a while to resolve.

To be frank, all of these downsides are things that are worth enduring to get a better end result. Being more involved in the technical side didn't slow me down once I'd got my foundational knowledge nailed, and spending a little more time upfront to have a beautiful, blazing-fast site is time well spent. The results speak for themselves.

**Tips for a successful JAMstack launch**
Since you're going to be working so closely with developers, it would be a good idea to sit down from the outset and plan out how things are going to work. Your developers are going to need to know exactly what functionality you need so that it can be built into the site. If you're using a headless CMS, you'll need to be clear about what data and content you expect to be pulled out of the CMS and into your static site.

You will likely require integrations with your favourite tools and services and tracking for analytics. Depending on what stack you decide to use, the answer to how this will be connected together might be different. So it's important to iron out these expectations from the start so nothing gets missed.

## Conclusion

As digital marketing professionals, we should be sticking our heads above the water from time to time. I've been in marketing for the best part of a decade and I've witnessed my fair share of communication disjoint between teams. This is increasingly difficult as the marketing stack becomes more complex, and when things like site performance are more critical than ever.

There's a lot to be learnt from spending more time with developers and being bold enough to try emerging technology that directly impacts the role of a digital marketer. If a company is going to ask their engineers and their marketers to work on a website, then the approach needs to be something that works for both teams. If I was tasked with relaunching any well-established marketing website in 2019 ‚Äì I'd go with the JAMstack and a headless CMS to keep things sane!

title: Sourcing from Kentico Cloud
---

In this guide, you'll go through how to quickly source content for your Gatsby site from [Kentico Cloud](https://kenticocloud.com/).

Kentico Cloud is a hosted CMS that offers you Content as a Service (CaaS) for all your content needs. Using CaaS ensures that your content will be future-proof and reusable, so you can add a mobile app that uses the same content as your Gatsby site without worrying about how it will fit. Kentico Cloud offers CaaS with an easy-to-use editing interface and excellent collaboration features, so all your work on content can happen in one place without requiring technical help for each user.

You can also take advantage of Kentico Cloud's ability to deliver content in multiple languages and create relationships among various content with linked items. However you structure your content in Kentico Cloud, the [source plugin](https://github.com/Kentico/gatsby-source-kentico-cloud) will ensure the proper nodes are created for your Gatsby site.

_Note: For this guide, you'll work from scratch from the [Gatsby default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) to get a feel for how sourcing from Kentico Cloud works. If you'd like to look at an example of a complete basic site, have a look at the [Kentico Cloud Gatsby starter site](https://github.com/Kentico/gatsby-starter-kentico-cloud), which includes worked examples for querying content._

## Setup

### Kentico Cloud

The first thing to do, if you haven't already done so, is [sign up for a Kentico Cloud account](https://app.kenticocloud.com/sign-up). This will automatically start a free 30-day trial with all Kentico Cloud features. At any point during the trial or after, you can switch to a Starter plan (which always starts as free) or a higher plan with more features.

Once you have a subscription to Kentico Cloud, you need some content to retrieve. If you know what you want, you can set up your own content types (templates for your content) and then create content items (the actual content) based on them. If you'd like to take a shortcut and see some example content, you can use our [Sample Project generator](https://app.kenticocloud.com/sample-project-generator) to create sample content. This guide will continue with the example of the Sample Project.

The created Sample Project is a comprehensive presentation of a fictional coffee company named Dancing Goat that showcases various Kentico Cloud features. It can be displayed in various channels, as you can see by going to the [Quickstart page in Kentico Cloud](https://app.kenticocloud.com/quickstart) from within that project.

For this guide, you don't have to worry about most of the features. You'll just pull some data to display within the Gatsby site you'll create in the next step. The only thing you need to continue is your Project ID, which you can find in Kentico Cloud under _Project settings_ -> _API keys_.

### Gatsby

#### Adding content to existing pages

Now that you have some content to pull, you can create a basic Gatsby site to display the content. Assuming you have the [Gatsby CLI installed](/docs/quick-start/#install-gatsbys-command-line-tool), create a new site and navigate to it in your terminal:

'''shell
gatsby new kentico-cloud-guide
cd kentico-cloud-guide
'''

Next, install the [Kentico Cloud source plugin](https://github.com/Kentico/gatsby-source-kentico-cloud):

'''shell
npm install --save gatsby-source-kentico-cloud
'''

Once that's done, you need to add the plugin to `gatsby-config.js`:

'''javascript
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
   ...
  },
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-kentico-cloud`,
        options: {
          deliveryClientConfig: {
            projectId: `<YourProjectID>` // Fill in your Project ID
          },
          // Please note that with the Sample Project generated above, `en-US` is the default language for the project and this config. For a blank project, this needs to be `default`.
          languageCodenames: [
                    `en-US` // Or the languages in your project (Project settings -> Localization)
          ]
      }
    },
    ...
'''

And that's enough for you to be able to access content from Kentico Cloud in your site. You can see this by starting Gatsby in development mode:

'''shell
gatsby develop
'''

To see all the content that's available from Kentico Cloud, you can test out GraphQL queries in GraphiQL at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. Nodes from Kentico Cloud will be prefixed with `kenticoCloud` (for single nodes) or `allKenticoCloud` (for all examples of a given type). Then each node has `Item` or `Type`, depending on what it is, and lastly you can add the codename of a specific type you are looking for. Feel free to explore the responses in GraphiQL.

To see how to put that data into your site, first go to `http://localhost:8000/`. Notice that the default title for the site is "Gatsby Default Starter". You can change that by pulling the title for your site from Kentico Cloud.

The title here is generated in the layout from the site metadata. By default, the Kentico Cloud Sample Project has a single item named "Home" that is the only item of the Home type. So you can change the layout component to query the metadata of that item and then use that data to populate your title.

'''javascript:title=src/components/layout.js
...
const Layout = ({ children }) => (
  <StaticQuery
    query={graphql`
      query {
        kenticoCloudItemHome {
          elements {
            metadata__meta_title {
              value
            }
          }
        }
      }
    `}
    render={data => (
      <>
        <Header siteTitle={data.kenticoCloudItemHome.elements.metadata__meta_title.value} />
...
'''

If you look at `http://localhost:8000/`, you'll notice the title is now "Dancing Goat‚ÄìFreshest coffee on the block!". You can easily change this title in Kentico Cloud to whatever you want and rerun `gatsby develop` to rebuild the site ([see below about automatic builds](#continuous-deployment)).

So you've seen how to add content to existing pages in Gatsby using Kentico Cloud. Next, you will start creating new pages of your own.

#### Creating new pages

It's great to be able to add content to existing static pages, but one of the great benefits of using CaaS is being able to define pages in Kentico Cloud and having them generated automatically. To see how, you'll add pages based on content from the Sample Project in the Article type (feel free to explore how these are structured in Kentico Cloud).

Start by making use of the URL pattern in the Article type to generate slugs for your Article nodes:

'''javascript:title=gatsby-node.js
exports.onCreateNode = ({ node, actions: { createNodeField } }) => {
  if (node.internal.type === `KenticoCloudItemArticle`) {
    createNodeField({
      node,
      name: `slug`,
      value: node.elements.url_pattern.value,
    })
  }
}
'''

Now that you have a pretty way to define the path for your pages, you can create the pages programmatically:

'''javascript:title=gatsby-node.js
const path = require(`path`) // highlight-line

exports.onCreateNode = ({ node, actions: { createNodeField } }) => {
  if (node.internal.type === `KenticoCloudItemArticle`) {
    createNodeField({
      node,
      name: `slug`,
      value: node.elements.url_pattern.value,
    })
  }
}

// highlight-start
exports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  const { createPage } = actions

  // Query data from Kentico
  const result = await graphql(`
    {
      allKenticoCloudItemArticle {
        edges {
          node {
            fields {
              slug
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  // Create pages
  result.data.allKenticoCloudItemArticle.edges.forEach(({ node }) => {
    createPage({
      path: node.fields.slug,
      component: path.resolve(`src/templates/article.js`),
      context: {
        slug: node.fields.slug,
      },
    })
  })
}
// highlight-end
'''

Now create a basic template to display each article with a title and the body that you pull with a GraphQL query:

'''javascript:title=src/templates/article.js
import React from "react"
import { graphql } from "gatsby"

import Layout from "../components/layout"

const Article = ({ data }) => {
  const item = data.kenticoCloudItemArticle.elements

  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>{item.title.value}</h1>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: item.body_copy.value }} />
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default Article

export const query = graphql`
  query articleQuery($slug: String!) {
    kenticoCloudItemArticle(fields: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {
      fields {
        slug
      }
      elements {
        body_copy {
          value
        }
        title {
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
'''

When you rerun `gatsby develop`, you'll be able to see each article as a page with content pulled from Kentico Cloud. To see a list of all pages, visit `http://localhost:8000/asdf` (or any other url that generates a 404).

The body copy for this article comes from a rich text element in Kentico Cloud. Links and inline linked items (e.g., embedded videos) are not resolved by default for rich text elements. If you want to resolve them, you can use the [embedded JS SDK resolution](https://github.com/Kentico/gatsby-source-kentico-cloud#embedded-js-sdk-resolution) or query the required data in structured form for resolution and create your own React components for [inline content items](https://github.com/Kentico/gatsby-source-kentico-cloud#content-items-in-rich-text-elements), [links](https://github.com/Kentico/gatsby-source-kentico-cloud#links-in-rich-text-elements), and [images](https://github.com/Kentico/gatsby-source-kentico-cloud#images-in-rich-text-elements).

Now you know how to create pages programmatically and pull their content from Kentico Cloud. To get the most out of your CaaS, you'll want to also make sure your site builds automatically whenever published content changes inside Kentico Cloud.

### Continuous deployment

To keep your site static but always up to date with the latest content from Kentico Cloud, it helps to set up automatic deployment whenever your published content changes. Here, you can see how to set that up using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/), but the principle is similar using other services like [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), as with another [site sourced from Kentico Cloud](https://github.com/Kentico/kentico.github.io/wiki/How-the-automatic-deployment-works).

For simple automatic deployment from Netlify, first store your site's source code in a Git provider such as GitHub. Then log in to Netlify (e.g., through the same Git provider), create a new site from Git, and choose your site's source code. Netlify should automatically detect that you're using Gatsby and include the `gatsby build` command. If so, go ahead and deploy your site. Your site will now automatically build whenever you push changes to the source code in the Git repository.

Now that your site's up and running, you need to set up automatic builds when published content in Kentico Cloud changes. First, in Netlify [create a new build hook](https://www.netlify.com/docs/webhooks/) with a name like "Change in Kentico Cloud content" and copy the URL. Then go to Kentico Cloud. Under _Project settings_, choose _Webhooks_ and create a new webhook. Give it a name like "Netlify build" and paste the URL into the _URL address_ field. And that's it. Now whenever published content changes ([see what actions call a webhook](https://developer.kenticocloud.com/docs/webhooks#section-when-webhooks-are-called)), your webhook will trigger a build in Netlify to ensure your static content is updated to the latest version.

## What's next?

You've seen how to set up a simple Gatsby site that sources content from Kentico Cloud and is automatically redeployed on any change to the content. Kentico Cloud is capable of creating many other kinds of relationships, including taxonomies for categorization, multiple languages, and linking items together. Want to do more?

## _docs_docs_browser_support_md
```---
title: Browser Support
---

Gatsby supports
[the same browsers as the current stable version of React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-dom.html#browser-support)
which is currently IE9+ as well as the most recent versions of other popular
browsers.

## Polyfills

Gatsby leverages Babel 7's ability to automatically add polyfills for your
target browsers.

Newer browsers support more JavaScript APIs than older browsers. For older
versions, Gatsby (via Babel) automatically adds the minimum "polyfills"
necessary for your code to work in those browsers.

If you start using a newer JavaScript API like `[].includes` that isn't
supported by some of your targeted browsers, you won't have to worry about it
breaking the older browsers as Babel will automatically add the needed polyfill
`core-js/modules/es7.array.includes`.

## Specify what browsers your project supports using "Browserslist"

You may customize your list of supported browser versions by declaring a
[`"browserslist"`](https://github.com/ai/browserslist) key within your
`package.json`. Changing these values will modify your JavaScript (via
[`babel-preset-env`](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env#targetsbrowsers))
and your CSS (via [`autoprefixer`](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer))
output.

This article is a good introduction to the growing community of tools around
Browserslist ‚Äî https://css-tricks.com/browserlist-good-idea/

By default, Gatsby emulates the following config:

'''javascript:title=package.json
{
 "browserslist": [
   ">0.25%",
   "not dead"
 ]
}
'''

If you only support newer browsers, make sure to specify this in your
`package.json`. This will often enable you to ship smaller JavaScript files.

title: "Journey to the Content Mesh Part 3: The Rise of Modern Web Development"
author: "Sam Bhagwat"
"date": 2018-10-11
tags: ["content-mesh"]

_This is Part 3 of a series. Part 1 is_ [The Journey to a Content Mesh](/blog/2018-10-04-journey-to-the-content-mesh) _and Part 2 is_ [Unbundling of the CMS](/blog/2018-10-10-unbundling-of-the-cms).

Developing for the web is _hard_. With millions of properties on the Internet, website developers have to create experiences that are compelling enough to engage audiences when new destinations are only a few keystrokes away.

And while creating rich user experiences is never an easy task, walled-garden CMS development environments introduce additional challenges. Teams are forced to work around them, but ultimately deliver less rich experiences at higher cost.

## Traditional CMS development presents challenges

Some challenges of traditional CMS development environments include:

- **Walled-garden development.** Work on projects across CMS systems often requires reimplementing basic functionality like carousels or banners. Development can be blocked due to CMS access restrictions or code freezes. Upgrade paths can be challenging when CMSs don‚Äôt support component UI versioning.

- **Maintaining local environments**. Setting up a local app server and database and keeping it up to date with team members‚Äô changes is time-consuming, especially when switching between projects or returning after a gap in development.

- **Project organization.** Reliably installing and managing third-party dependencies, including cross-compatibility and handling bugs in upstream, is challenging. Vanilla JavaScript offers no standard project organization or code bundling patterns.

- **A difficult target environment.** Cross-browser API incompatibilities, global DOM application state, and imperative DOM APIs make it easy to inadvertently introduce bugs.

## The rise of modern frameworks

Luckily, we know how to fix these problems. Over the last five years, two modern web frameworks, React and Angular, have taken the web world by storm.

## Modern frameworks offer stability and faster development

Modern frameworks offer built-in performance and testing patterns/tools, encourage componentized/modular code, enable code reuse across teams, enable monolithic apps to be broken into smaller, more maintainable services, and offer a rich ecosystem to allow developers to quickly solve common problems instead of wasting cycles reinventing wheels.

Their _ubiquity_ adds stability to the landscape; React and Angular have become universal. With ubiquity comes an ecosystem of high-quality components -- tables, forms, date-pickers, whole design systems -- that are open-source and available for plugging into any site.

Modern frameworks also represent a core _technology advance_ over previous solutions that make it much easier to create visually rich, low-defect frontends:

- **Reusable UIs.** Key UI elements, such as headers, dropdowns, typeaheads, buttons, tables and so forth may be reused across the application, without copy-pasta.

- **Local application state.** Previous methods of modifying web page display relied on global state. When code at any place can modify state everywhere, the result at scale is spaghetti code. In React/Angular‚Äôs component model, components cannot modify outside state without being granted explicit permission.

- **A declarative virtual DOM.** Instead of imperatively changing specific page elements‚Äô state in reaction to specific user actions, developers can specify desired UI state as a "view" on application state, making code more readable and less buggy.

React and Angular, along with mature ES2015+ JavaScript, and stable dependency/bundling solutions like npm and webpack, are blowing away conceptions of JS as an unserious language. They are in production of leading Fortune 500 companies, including Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Autodesk, Airbnb, and McDonalds.

## Modern frameworks enable compelling content experiences

While React and Angular were originally created as web _app_ solutions, with the rise of the headless CMS, usage of React and Angular on _websites_ has skyrocketed, growing 5-10X since early 2017.

title: Introducing Gatsby Themes
date: 2018-11-11
author: Chris Biscardi
excerpt: "Scaling the production of Gatsby sites"
tags: ["themes"]
---

Gatsby is a powerful platform for building marketing sites, blogs,
ecommerce frontends, and more. You can source data from static files
and any number of content management systems. You can process images,
add support for our favorite styling technique, transform markdown,
and just about anything else you can imagine.

At its core, a Gatsby site is a combination of functionality centered
around a single config file, `gatsby-config.js`. This config file
controls an assortment of site metadata, data type mapping, and most
importantly, plugins. Plugins contain large amounts of customizable
functionality for turning markdown into pages, processing components
into documentation, and even processing images.

## Scaling Gatsby

Creating a single Gatsby site works super well. The power of
`gatsby-config.js`, plugins, and more coalesce to make the experience a
breeze. However, what if you want to re-use this configuration on our
next site? Sure, you could clone a boilerplate each time, but that gets
old, quickly. Wouldn't it be great if you could re-use our
gatsby-config.js across projects? That's where starters come in.

### Improving Reusability with Starters

One way to create more sites with similar functionality faster is to
use starters. Starters are basically whole Gatsby sites that can be
scaffolded through the gatsby CLI. This helps you start your project
by cloning the boilerplate, installing dependencies, and clearing Git
history. The community around Gatsby has built a lot of different
starters for various use cases including blogging, working with
material design, and documentation.

The problem with starters is that they're one-offs. Starters are
boilerplate projects that begin to diverge immediately from upstream
and have no easy way of updating when changes are made
upstream. There's another approach to boilerplate that has become
popular in recent years that fixes some problems with the boilerplate
approach such as updating with upstream. One such project is
[`create-react-app`](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/). In
the Gatsby world, you can improve on starters similarly with themes.

### Truly Reusable Themes in Gatsby

If a single `gatsby-config.js` encodes the functionality of a whole Gatsby
site, then if you can
[compose](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-function-composition-20dfb109a1a0)
the `gatsby-config.js` data structure together you have the base for
themes. You can encode portions of our gatsby-config as themes and
re-use them across sites. This is a big deal because you can have a
theme config (or multiple configs) that composes together with the
custom config (for the current site). Upgrading the underlying theme
does not undo the customizations, meaning you get upstream
improvements to the theme without a difficult manual upgrade process.

## Why Themes?

Defining themes as the base composition unit of Gatsby sites allows us to start
solving a variety of use cases. For example, when a site gets built as
part of a wider product offering it's often the case that one team
will build out a suite of functionality, including branding elements,
and the other teams will mostly consume this functionality. Themes
allow us to distribute this functionality as an npm package and allow
the customization of various branding elements through our
`gatsby-config.js`.

## Mechanics of Theming

At a base level, theming combines the `gatsby-config.js` of the
theme with the `gatsby-config.js` of your site. Since it's an experimental
feature, you use an experimental namespace to declare themes in
the config.

'''js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-theme-blog",
      options: {},
    },
  ],
}
'''

Themes often need to be parameterized for various reasons, such as
changing the base url for subsections of a site or applying branding
variables. You can do this through the theme options if you define our
theme's gatsby-config as a function that returns an object.

'''js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-theme-blog",
      options: {
        some: "value",
      },
    },
  ],
}
'''

Themes also function as plugins and any config passed into the theme
in your `gatsby-config.js` will also be passed to your theme's `gatsby-*.js`
files as plugin options. This allows themes to override any settings
inherited from the theme's own plugin declarations or apply gatsby
lifecycle hooks such as [`onCreatePage`](/docs/node-apis/#onCreatePage).

Check out the theme examples in this multi-package repo for more
examples of using and building themes: https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-theme-examples.

## Next Steps

### Sub Themes and Overriding

This is just the first step and it enables us to experiment with
further improvements in userland before merging them into
core. Sub-theming, for example, is a critical part of a theming
ecosystem that is currently missing from Gatsby. Overriding theme
elements is possible on a coarse level right now in userland. If, for
example, a theme defines a set of pages using
[`createPage`](/docs/actions/#createPage) you can define a helper
function that will look for the page component first in the user's
site and then fall back to the theme's default implementation.

'''js
const withThemePath = relativePath => {
  let pathResolvedPath = path.resolve(relativePath)
  let finalPath = pathResolvedPath

  try {
    // check if the user's site has the file
    require.resolve(pathResolvedPath)
  } catch (e) {
    // if the user hasn't implemented the file,
    finalPath = require.resolve(relativePath)
  }

  return finalPath
}
'''

Then in our theme's `createPage` call, you simply use the helper to let
the user optionally override the default component.

'''title:gatsby-node.js
createPage({
  path: post.node.fields.slug,
  component: withThemePath('./src/templates/blog-post.js')
})
'''

This doesn't allow us to make more granular overrides of different
components, but it does allow us to replace the rendering of pages and
other whole elements. Component Shadowing, a more granular method of
overriding, is already in the works.

@pieh, thanks for advice, but it was not helpful (https://circleci.com/gh/hands-on-cloud/hands-on.cloud/23). I've already tried to play with GATSBY_CPU_COUNT={1,2} and --max-old-space-size={1024,2048,4096}.
I've also tried to use Node 12.2.0. Still getting this error.
This generate images part of deployment is crucial part of whole framework. With each blog post deployment it takes more resources because of growing images count. Right now I have 20 posts and 160 images with mean size 250k. Probably we have memory leak somewhere, but I'm not strong Node dev yet to prove\fix it by myself.

@pieh, probably, guys from next.js found the reason of the problem: zeit/next.js#6353.
They added experimental CPU configuration option through CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL env var: https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/6604/files.

This may be fixed in #14624. Sharp wasn't actually using this environment variable, so the images may have been using too many CPUs as a result!

We were running into issues that I think were related to this.  Our builds were happening within a docker container on CircleCI.  The issues went away when we switched away from using docker containers and building using the machine executor.
Could be worth a try for anyone else blocked by this issue.

Just a heads-up. We had the same issue here today and in our case we had a few images larger than 4000px and resizing them to 1920px solved the issue without having to touch circle config.

        Recover from solved errors in nested files without restarting `develop`
      
```

```
Text:
```

Summary
When errors occur within files within directories, the errors are reported on the command line and in the browser (this is good!). However, when the error has been resolved by removing the offending files, the errors do not go away.
Reproduction steps

Start a new site using gatsby new
Start the development server and navigate to a working page in the browser
Add a folder under pages with a JavaScript with an error in it (for instance, import blah from 'blah' - an import of a non-existent package)
The error appears in the browser and the command line
Remove the folder again
Refresh the page in the browser a bunch of times - the error appears intermittently until gatsby develop

Motivation
To prevent confusion about false negative error reporting.

        [gatsby-source-contentful] Internal absolute links to same domain are treated as relative links

Text:
```

Description
I have absolute urls in my blog posts that navigate to other blog posts. When clicking on these links, the absolute url is treated as a relative url, which sends the user to a 404 page.
Environment
Gatsby version: 1.9.153
Node.js version: 8.9.1
Operating System: MacOS High Sierra 10.13.2
Actual result
Internal link: https://example.com/new-post
End url: https://example.com/https://example.com/new-post
Expected behavior
This should act naturally like an absolute url would.

Text:

@calcsam @KyleAMathews
Ok, so I tried my best to work this out and find a proper bug, but I couldn't narrow it down. What I came to realize is that it only happens when the absolute link has the same root domain. I had not seen this issue in dev or our QA environment because the links work fine when it's not the same root. I.e., when I'm on localhost the absolute links link out properly to our site. Same with our qablog.example.com. But once we're in prod and pointing those absolute links to other pages with the same root, this issue occurs. I can only think this is a React Router issue.
We are migrating our blog, and our past CMS used absolute links when creating links in a post to other posts. So this is the nature of what we're working with. One solution is to go through and modify all the links, which I don't have time to do with over 100 posts. To solve this, I used a regex to turn any internal absolute links into relative ones and this solves the problem. If I find anything else, I'll be sure to post.
Below are the plugins we are currently using.

        [gatsby-image] Dynamically change image source after page load like in picture tag
      
```
Author:
```
rtm619
```
Text:
```

Hi,
Currently, Gatsby Image uses srcset attribute of img tag to load different images based on window width at loading time. But unlike picture tag, if you resize the window (suppose from desktop to smartphone width in chrome), the image source doesn't change. You have to reload the website again in that smartphone width to get the smartphone image. Is there a way where you can change image sources by varying window width without reloading the page, like in picture tag which uses media queries?

```

I had the same issue but I found the solution
TL;DR - Gatsby Image doesn't support picture tag so I had to use a hack of display: none;

Hi @rtm619
with the srcset attribute you can't assume that the browser will change the image on resize. Most of the browsers are not changing the image if they have already loaded a large version of it.
If you need a different image on different screen sizes you have to use the picture tag and can't use Gatsby Image. srcset and Gatsby Image are great for images which are just changing the resolution because the browser is figuring out which resolution is the best and saves bandwidth when it is not changing the src on resize.
Here is a bit of a background to srcset vs. picture: https://cloudfour.com/thinks/dont-use-picture-most-of-the-time/#knowing-which-use-case-youre-solving-tells-you-what-solution-you-need

Text:

This fixes a bug in gatsby-dev-cli where the cache-dir was copying to the wrong spot--and likely other files as well.
path.basename(path.dirname(somePath)) infers the parent folder of the current file, not the packages/${packageName} that we actually want.
Additionally, this PR fixes an issue with non-existant files causing the ready event to never be triggered. That particular issue has been fixed, and seems to be related to paulmillr/chokidar#449

        feat(gatsby-transformer-sharp): allow screenshot placeholder
      
```
Author:

pieh
```
Text:
```

Developing and building gatsbyjs.org is quite painful because of all the screenshots that are needed to be fetched and processed. It also doesn't allow us to get deploy previews for PRs against www. This PR give option to use GATSBY_SCREENSHOT_PLACEHOLDER=true gatsby build/develop and skip fetching and processing of all screenshots which mean that:
a) local development can be done faster if screenshots dev is not done for showcase related areas
b) we can get deploy previews from netlify again for PRs (would need to update netlify site to use GATSBY_SCREENSHOT_PLACEHOLDER env var
Here's how site showcase looks like when using placeholder from this PR:

Initial gatsby develop using that was ready to use in ~5 minutes on my local machine (there are still lot of images to process in blog and docs) as opposed to 15-20 minutes if we would need to download and process screenshots.

Updated placeholder, still not great but probably looks better (used grayish background so screenshot cards stand out a little from white background:

It's just a image file packed in screenshot package, so it can always be updated in the future.

        feat(gatsby-transformer-remark): Allow for multiple different remark sources
      
```
Author:
```
alexkirsz
```
Text:
```

This PR allows for having more than one gatsby-transformer-remark plugin. With the addition of the filter option, the user can now decide which nodes should be handled by which plugin. For instance, with gatsby-source-filesystem, one could do the following in order to have multiple different markdown sources:
const plugins = [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
    options: {
      path: `${__dirname}/src/pages`,
      name: `pages`,
    },
  },
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
    options: {
      path: `${__dirname}/src/blog`,
      name: `blog`,
    },
  },
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
    options: {
      filter: node => node.sourceInstanceName === `pages`,
      type: `MarkdownPage`,
    },
  },
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
    options: {
      filter: node => node.sourceInstanceName === `blog`,
      type: `BlogPost`,
    },
  }
]
I've also added a type option so that these different plugins create GraphQL types with different names.
In the above example, we could expect that our markdown pages might have different frontmatter fields than our blog entries, but having them all under the MarkdownRemark type would force us to add filters on fields in order to only retrieve a list of either of them. Having different frontmatter formats would also pollute our GraphiQL documentation.

Thanks @alexkirsz üëç this is a really useful feature - so much so, that something like it should be added to Gatsby core instead of this being implemented separately across different plugins.
It'll be particularly useful for the new Gatsby themes functionality that @ChristopherBiscardi is working on. As part of the themes work there's going to be an issue or rfc soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è (next week or after) to figure out exactly how this could be added to Gatsby core. Once the rfc has been written I'll add a link here.

In an effort to reproduce caching issues, I created a simple Gatsby + Shopify example. Similar to gatsbyjs/store.gatsbyjs.org, this uses the same Gatsby Swag store account/instance in Shopify (which also commits the SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN to version control!).
This one is more read-only, and renders a list of products, and then product detail with a thumbnail switcher.

@phacks this was done rather intentionally.
Would you want to walk me through the benefit? This saves us quite a bit of wasted cycles, for instance, consider the following:

PR updates packages/gatsby-image

Test suite will run


We ask for documentation changes; original requestor updates docs/gatsby-image.md (or whatever)

test suite will not run, because doing so is wasted CI time



Happy to hear other perspectives on this, because I do think it can be confusing, but I think the overall effect is valuable.

@DSchau Thanks for explaining, it‚Äôs clearer for me now :)
However I think it might be a bit dangerous to keep it that way: imagine the following PR pushed in one time :

commit aaaaaa <== updates packages/gatsby-image, unfortunately breaks unit tests
commit bbbbbb <== updates examples/using-gatsby-image

If you take the PR as a whole CI should break, however today it does not. It might give a sense of false security for the PR author and reviewer.
PR #9462 is a good example: original PR updated packages/gatsby-plugin-sass and packages/gatsby-plugin-less and initially ended with a commit changing the migration guide in docs/. In that case, unit tests would not be ran in the current setup.
Does that help?

Specifying the directory as part of the repository field in a package.json allows npm and third party tools to provide better support when working with monorepos. For example, it allows them to correctly construct a commit diff for a specific package.
This format was accepted by npm in npm/rfcs#19.

Text:
```

@wardpeet what do you mean by older versions? I'm not sure how this change could break any yarn or npm versions, and it's already been adopted by the folks at react, blueprint and jest without any problems.
As I understand it, currently the repository links here aren't usable directly by git, so they may currently be breaking very old versions of npm and yarn (although I doubt it).

```
Author:
```
DSchau
```
Text:
```

@greysteil would that actually work?
Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but given gatsby-source-filesystem (as an example), the URL would have to be https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby.git and the directory would then be packages/gatsby-source-filesystem right?
But... the directory keyword wouldn't work with the existing URL, right?
Happy to be corrected here--more a clarifying question so I understand than anything else! Thanks!

```
Author:
```
greysteil
```
Text:
```

@DSchau - depends how it's implemented. It wouldn't be that hard to split the directory out of existing URLs (we have logic to do that in Dependabot here already that I could port to npm).
Thinking about it, though, I think it probably makes more sense to work. I'm hoping to have PRs for npm and yarn in the next couple of days, so this should be mergeable as-is before to long.

The gatsby module resolve by require might not be the gatsby module that is executing. This can occur in mono-repo configurations.
