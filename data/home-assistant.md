```Home Assistant |Chat Status|
=================================================================================

Home Assistant is a home automation platform running on Python 3. It is able to track and control all devices at home and offer a platform for automating control.

To get started:

.. code:: bash

    python3 -m pip install homeassistant
    hass --open-ui

Check out `home-assistant.io <https://home-assistant.io>`__ for `a
demo <https://home-assistant.io/demo/>`__, `installation instructions <https://home-assistant.io/getting-started/>`__,
`tutorials <https://home-assistant.io/getting-started/automation-2/>`__ and `documentation <https://home-assistant.io/docs/>`__.

|screenshot-states|

Featured integrations
---------------------

|screenshot-components|

The system is built using a modular approach so support for other devices or actions can be implemented easily. See also the `section on architecture <https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/architecture_index.html>`__ and the `section on creating your own
components <https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/creating_component_index.html>`__.

If you run into issues while using Home Assistant or during development
of a component, check the `Home Assistant help section <https://home-assistant.io/help/>`__ of our website for further help and information.

## _CODE_OF_CONDUCT_md
```# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [safety@home-assistant.io][email]. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4,
available [here][version].

## Adoption

This Code of Conduct was first adopted January 21st, 2017 and announced in [this][coc-blog] blog post.

## _CONTRIBUTING_md
```# Contributing to Home Assistant

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to Home Assistant. There is a lot to do...if you are not a developer perhaps you would like to help with the documentation on [home-assistant.io](https://home-assistant.io/)? If you are a developer and have devices in your home which aren't working with Home Assistant yet, why not spend a couple of hours and help to integrate them?

The process is straight-forward.

 - Read [How to get faster PR reviews](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md#best-practices-for-faster-reviews) by Kubernetes (but skip step 0)
 - Fork the Home Assistant [git repository](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant).
 - Write the code for your device, notification service, sensor, or IoT thing.
 - Ensure tests work.
 - Create a Pull Request against the [**dev**](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/tree/dev) branch of Home Assistant.

Still interested? Then you should take a peek at the [developer documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/) to get more details.

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        Google Assistant, voice comes after command?

Make sure you are running the latest version of Home Assistant before reporting an issue.
You should only file an issue if you found a bug. Feature and enhancement requests should go in the Feature Requests section of our community forum:
Home Assistant release (hass --version):
0.59.2
Python release (python3 --version):
Component/platform:
google-assistant
Description of problem:
When using the google assistant component in hass, the voice of google home comes after the command has been run. E.g I say "Turn of all lights", and then after all lights has been turned off, my google home answers "Ok, turning all lights of"
Expected:
The opposite, E.g I say "Turn of all lights", my google home answer, "ok turning of all lights" then turning of all lights
Problem-relevant configuration.yaml entries and steps to reproduce:

This is something you'd need to raise with Google, since it's down to how they order the actions and not something that Home Assistant can control.

I am actually pretty happy that it happens faster than Google can say its been done.  It is actually faster than SmartThings.

This is intentional (by Google), as it has to first attempt to execute the command to get any potential errors and give them back to the user.
@olskar you should close the issue.

@ferdydek Are you sure about that? With IFTTT and hue bulbs, it is doing the "right order". But if youre sure im closing it

Let me put it this way - what HA's google assistant integration does is identical to how other smart home hubs (for example Philips hue) are behaving.
If you feel that we should have an option to choose if the GA behaves in both ways please create a new Feature Requests (https://community.home-assistant.io/c/feature-requests).

If there's not a recorder: line in your configuration.yaml then that's why there's no state history.

I'll give that a try. I'm not sure when that changed because I never had that line in there and never had an issue with state history before. I've updated the config file and I'll see if that works.

Also have this problem. Clicking on an entity in the frontend to view state history does not pop up the normal window, it only produces a message that the system_log.write service was called. Looking at the log the following message this is there:
ERROR (MainThread) [frontend.js.es5.201808310] http://x.x.x.x:8123/frontend_es5/app-8dfe9b8d.js:2:801147 Uncaught 

The message is clipped, but I am guessing there is some sort of exception in the frontend when trying to draw the history window.
My setup is also using postgres with pretty standard configurations for recorder and history. I can see recent updates in the database as well so the connection is fine and HA is logging stuff. It was otherwise working before upgrading from 0.75.3 to 0.77.2, though I definitely had it properly display the history window at least once on 0.77.2.
Update: this seems to be browser dependent. Works using Firefox, but not Vivaldi (based on Chromium).

I have the same problem in the front end, that is, the history window when clicking entities does not show, only the service called.  Works on all other browsers...should open in issue for this.

It's only in vivaldi this happens (no graphs or popups)...which is my main browser, but now back on opera due to this problem.

I tried clearing the db as well, no effect. I think we might have two separate issues here.
@ktpx Do you get any more detail in your log messages? Like I mentioned, mine is cut off in the logfile and I just get "Uncaught". It seems to be something with Vivaldi, but it's weird because Vivaldi's browser engine is the same as Chrome, but it works fine in Chrome for me.

I wonder if this perhaps has to do with home-assistant/home-assistant-polymer#1624 ? It seems like a frontend issue since it works for me in other browsers. Unfortunately, I tried adding javascript_version: latest as was suggested over there and it didn't help, but it's a start. I gonna dive into this more and possibly open another issue over there.

There hasn't been any activity on this issue recently. Due to the high number of incoming GitHub notifications, we have to clean some of the old issues, as many of them have already been resolved with the latest updates.
Please make sure to update to the latest Home Assistant version and check if that solves the issue. Let us know if that works for you by adding a comment üëç

@balloobbot This issue is still present in current versions. There's been no change, it still doesn't work.
I do think this issue is somehow specific to Vivaldi, which is strange because Vivaldi is reusing Chrome's rendering engine but I do not have this problem on Chrome. I don't really know how to debug this though, because there is no meaningful error message.

Still a problem. Hassio 0.97.2
Logbook shows data, individual sensors show history when put into a history-graph card, but nothing on the UI History page.
It was working up until I switched to using MariaDB, then worked once never to be seen again. I even reverted back from using MariaDB and still no History.

Same issue met and fixed on 0.99.2 with stock SQLite.
The issue happened when I rebooted my Pi for the first time. All the history and logbook are blanked, viewed both from the Lovelace and API, while the db file is still growing.
Renaming db file didn't work. However, when I renamed the .homeassistant folder and start hass again, the hass cannot automatically install and import certain packages. When I manually installed those packages through pip and renamed back my original folder, the system was back to work.
The packages I manually installed are netdisco==2.6.0 , hass-nabucasa==0.17 and home-assistant-frontend==20190919.0 .
I have little idea about the cause since all three packages are shown as "Attempting to install" in the log. Anyway it worked for me and the issue didn't show up again after rebooting.

Home Assistant release with the issue: 0.90.0 to 0.90.1
Last working Home Assistant release (if known): 0.89.2
Operating environment (Hass.io/Docker/Windows/etc.): Hass.io / Docker CE / Intel NUC / Ubuntu Server 18.0.4 LTS
Component/platform:  Appears to be - homekit_controller?
Description of problem:
Upgraded from 0.89.2 to 0.90.0 (and 0.90.1) and on boot, Hass.io fills my logs with about 27 of these tracebacks, all with different "MACs". I put those in quotes because these MACs are nowhere in my wireless controller (first thought, since it says "assuming IP based") and any OUI lookup I've spot checked returns unknown results.
Nothing seems broken so far, other than my OCD that there are logs I can't explain.
Problem-relevant configuration.yaml entries and (fill out even if it seems unimportant): Unknown at this point...

Traceback (if applicable):
8:52 AM components/homekit_controller/__init__.py (WARNING)

Log Details (WARNING)
Sun Mar 24 2019 08:52:30 GMT-0700 (PDT)

This is just a warning from an upstream library and is not a traceback as such.
The upstream library now supports IP and BLE connection types, and it assumes existing records are IP based but warns that your pairing.json is in an old format. This warning is completely harmless - it takes the right course of action.
These are HomeKit ID's no MAC addresses. They change every time you reset a device and are completely random. There will be one for every time you have done a homekit pairing, and you have 27 HomeKit pairings in your system. I'm guessing you don't have that many devices but have done a bunch of hard reset and re-pairs?
There is no mechanism for cleaning out old pairings through HA - this will be fixed by a branch I have in flight but the HA devs are really busy so getting even small PR's reviewed and merged takes time. In the meantime you can reduce the warnings by removing old records from your pairing.json file. If your configuration.yaml is in /config/ then you should have a /config/.homekit/pairing.json. There will be a bunch of other files in that folder starting with hk - you don't need them any more. Other than that, theres no easy way to tell which pairings are active. I think you can do something like python3 -m homekit.discover to see all active IP accessories on your network with their current homekit id.
For the remaining records you can totally fix your OCD by adding a "Connection": "IP" entry to each pairing.
Finally, the nuclear option is to rm (or mv to one side) your .homekit folder to one side and do one more reset and re-pair option. Then you'll only have one pairing per device and it should (i think) have the right Connection type set in pairing.json.
(Of course a future version will do the migration automatically, this is all purely to help your OCD until all of my outstanding branches are merged)

As always @Jc2k, you are beyond helpful; thank you for that detailed explanation, it's very much appreciated. I have 24 HomeKit devices (I was going all in before I stumbled on HA), with only a few resets... but no need to keep something open if the only thing that's broken is my OCD.

INFO:root:home_id 0xdf1e1fc0, controller node id is 1

I tried to set sensor to inclusion mode and restart home assistant, but even though I cannot see any error, I cannot see any new sensor in web interface of home assistant.
Should the sensor be added and visible to home assistant automatically or should add new sensor item into config file?

Is the sensor set up to report it's status to your controller stick?
Once the stick picks up a Value being broadcasted it will load the sensor platform and show the sensor in the UI.

Hi, Thanks for info.
Yes, according to sensor documentation I briefly pushed button 3 times and sensor led shone blue, which should inclusion of sensro to z-wave network. But no new messages appeared in log file. I tried also minozw app from openzwave with the same behavior, so it seems that there something wrong with USB stick or sensor itself. I will do more investigation during weekend.

I have a Fibaro Smoke Sensor. If I try to use it with Hass (last I tried is 0.8), it will not work with similar results as you. It works fine in Domoticz though.
Is this maybe because it's a sleeping sensor for most of the time? I forced it into sending data by triggering the burglary alarm to no avail

It seems like compatibility issue between openzwave and USB Stick Vision ZU1401EU. On openzwave mailing list I found that same behavior was reported in June 2015 - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/openzwave/vision/openzwave/5FS5s0PsfRo/irVLhwPuDE4J.
@sebasdoes: What USB stick do you have?

Thanks for pasting your logs. It seems that you have different issue than me. In my log, I cannot see any communication of sensor. Only data from Node001, which is controller itself are in log. You have different USB stick than me, and according to openzwave mailing list, Vision USB doesn't work with openzwave correctly. I will return Vision USB and will order other one (Aeon probably).
I will leave the issue opened and will report situation, once new USB stick will arrive.

I exchanged USB sticks. I sent back Vision USB and purchased Aeon Z-Stick Gen5. I had to copy most recent openzwave config directory into /usr/local/share/python-openzwave because reference to commit in openzwave submodule doesn't contain configuration for Gen5 version. Now, I can see all 3 values in HA, so I'm closing the issue.
Thanks for help guys.

Ok, I see the bug. Most of my tests were for Hebrew. In case of setting language to english, the library does not provide a long description. I think this logic should be moved into the library in any case.

Make sure you are running the latest version of Home Assistant before reporting an issue.
You should only file an issue if you found a bug. Feature and enhancement requests should go in the Feature Requests section of our community forum:
Home Assistant release (hass --version):
0.35.0
Python release (python3 --version):
Python 3.5.2
Component/platform:
Kodi, media player
Description of problem:
I use the "playing" status on the Kodi component to dim our lights automatically. This works perfectly fine while playing regular media files. However, when playing Youtube or Twitch for example, the lights will start fading on/off constantly, seemingly thinking Kodi is both on and off all the time.
Expected:
No blinking.

Based on this line of code, I'd guess it's something to do with the live property.  However that's all the troubleshooting I can do without a device of my own!

This has been fixed in upstream (rytilahti/python-songpal@33efa2e) and is part of the currently required python-songpal version (0.0.7), so I'm closing it.

Is it possible to add those that would make the card complete and perfect.if not I will have to use custom cards
Cheers and thanks for this awesome projects

        WIP: Add basic suggestion component
      
```
Author:

Text:

Description:
Preview of a suggestions component I'm working on. Goal of this component is to provide suggestions to the user on which entities are popular to interact with during a specific period of time. Will be used to power a new lovelace card üòé
This is the initial implementation and so very limited on purpose. Eventually we can start taking users into account and the location of the users (once we have a component that binds users to device trackers).
Can be heavy to generate, so plan is to generate it once a day.
It's smart enough to ignore any service call that results from another service call (ie I call a script that turns on 5 lights, only the script will show in popular list)

        Add a global config object to Home Assistant
      
```
Author:
```
balloob
```
Text:
```

This adds a global config object to Home Assistant. It will auto detect location, temperature unit and time zone using the JSON api from freegeoip.net. Devices that have temperature states will have these automatically be converted to the preferred unit.
Config object contains the following information accessible at hass.config:

location
temperature unit
time zone
name of location where HA is running

(last two are not used right now).
Example configuration.yaml entries:
homeassistant:
  # Omitted values in this section will be auto detected using freegeoip.net

  # Location required to calculate the time the sun rises and sets
  latitude: 32.87336
  longitude: 117.22743

  # C for Celcius, F for Fahrenheit
  temperature_unit: C

  # Pick yours from here:
  # http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
  time_zone: America/Los_Angeles

  # Name of the location where Home Assistant is running
  name: Home
This PR supersedes PR #23 . Thanks to @kangaroo for the idea of auto setting the temperature unit based on location.

        Add optional "all" parameter for groups
      
```
Author:
```
danielperna84
```
Text:
```

Description:
The current way groups work as per the documentation

When any member of a group is on then the group will also be on.

This may usually be what people expect. I do believe though, that there are cases where a groups state should only turn to on if all entities are on. I myself once wanted that, forgot what it was though and probably ended up using some workaround.
One simple example would be monitoring if a group of devices is on. Like: Notify me if not all devices of a particular group are on (alarm system or whatever). If one node goes down, the whole group is considered down. It's pretty straightforward to build an automation based on that single state of the group instead of writing templates or creating helper-entities.
Marked es WIP because I want to gather opinions on this before I start with the tests and update the documentation
Essentially this PR keeps using any as the default, but overrides that if all is set to true.

If there are just 2 modes (any/all) why make this a string?
An all: true seems to be more elegant in that case.

You're right, makes sense.

The advantage of a string over a boolean is that it doesn't require a breaking change in the future if another mode would be added. Although I must admit that I can't think of any.

Remove all your change (sorry but look like "I don't know what I do, so I do everything") and add a SCAN_INTERVAL=timedelta(minutes=30) on top of your file

```

```
tsvi
```
Text:

@pvizeli There's merit to what @zalke is trying to do. The sensors calculate times that are part of the Jewish calendar. There's no point in calculating every 30 seconds as the sensors only update values a few times a day. Please see my review.
Changing to a scan interval of 30 minutes won't help as we might miss the exact time we want the sensors to be updated.

@zalke if you have no plans on modifying your code, I suggest this PR be closed.
I'll try to implement your excellent suggestions in the future, but it's definitely not a priority for me.
Thank you very much for your insights.
