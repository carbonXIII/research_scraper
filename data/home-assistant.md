                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## _CONTRIBUTING_md
```# Contributing to Home Assistant

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to Home Assistant. There is a lot to do...if you are not a developer perhaps you would like to help with the documentation on [home-assistant.io](https://home-assistant.io/)? If you are a developer and have devices in your home which aren't working with Home Assistant yet, why not spend a couple of hours and help to integrate them?

The process is straight-forward.

 - Read [How to get faster PR reviews](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md#best-practices-for-faster-reviews) by Kubernetes (but skip step 0)
 - Fork the Home Assistant [git repository](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant).
 - Write the code for your device, notification service, sensor, or IoT thing.
 - Ensure tests work.
 - Create a Pull Request against the [**dev**](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/tree/dev) branch of Home Assistant.

Still interested? Then you should take a peek at the [developer documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/) to get more details.

## _CODE_OF_CONDUCT_md
```# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [safety@home-assistant.io][email]. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4,
available [here][version].

## Adoption

This Code of Conduct was first adopted January 21st, 2017 and announced in [this][coc-blog] blog post.

Generally this is a system configuration issue and not an application issue. Check that the settings are reasonable for both your number of threads allowed and the stack size for each thread. Sometimes in trying to solve other problems, the stack size gets set unreasonably high, which then means it tries to allocate a huge amount of memory for each thread. FYI, this seems to be a fairly common problem with the default settings some system-on-a-chip systems like Raspberry Pi.

        Generalized MQTT switch component(s)
      
```
Author:
```
jasonmhite
```
Text:
```

One thing that would really be handy for me is a switch component that is "generalized" in the sense that it can have more than two states. My use case is that I have a thermostat that I built that takes commands over MQTT. I'd like to be able to toggle it between a discrete set of states fan/heat/cool etc and have it send the appropriate MQTT message to set that state. I could write a specialized component for it like with e.g. the Nest, but I think the functionality is generally a lot more useful so I figured I'd suggest it.
Basically what I imagine is something like:
switch:
  general_mqtt_switch:
     name: thermostat  state  
     available_states:
       heat: "heat_on"
       cool: "cool_on"
       off: "turn_off"
       fan: "fan_on"
     control_topic: thermostat/control/state
     state_topic: thermostat/info
     value_template: ...

Then, in the web interface, it'd expose a toggle selector (maybe something like a Bootstrap button group?). When you select one of the values, it then sends the given message to the control_topic. Homeassistant also would monitor state_topic to determine the current state, where the value_template can be given to parse the messages receieved into the states listed as the keys of available_states, which could possibly be indicated by highlighting the current state in the selector.
The other component that I think might be useful would be similar, basically a text-box input. My use case here would be to let me send an arbitrary payload to a given MQTT topic, namely a temperature setting for the thermostat. I imagine something like:
switch:
  mqtt_value_switch:
    name: thermostat temp
    topic: thermostat/control/temp

This would render in the webui as a textbox and a "submit" button. When you hit submit, it'd just dump the value in the text box to the specified MQTT topic.
Thanks for considering this! I really am enjoying using HA and I think these would be quite useful and I could ditch the custom webui I've written and have everything nicely integrated into HA. These are components that are obviously extremely flexible, so I think lots of people might find uses of their own for them.

The next release will introduce an input_select component that will get you half way to where you want to be.

```
Author:

jasonmhite
```
Text:
```

Closing, as input_select combined with the changes in #1510 make this possible. Short summary is to create an input_select with the entries that you want and add an automation rule that uses data_template to send the selected value whenever the input is changed.
Also, I missed that feature requests are supposed to go on the forum, so this doesn't belong here anyway.

We are no longer storing the UTC offset of when an event was recorded. This has the downside that machine learning algorithms or pattern detection algorithms do not know what the actual time was at the location where the event was fired. Was it 9 in the morning or 5 in the afternoon.

        Deconz lights not showing correctly in UI

Home Assistant release with the issue:
0.72.1
Last working Home Assistant release (if known):
??
Operating environment
hassio on raspberry pi 3b with a conbee stick and Deconz add on
Component/platform:
https://www.home-assistant.io/components/deconz/
Description of problem:
When I change a light colour on the colour wheel for, say kitchen light, and then navigate away from that light in the UI and look at the settings for another light (dining room), the colour wheel will show the current colour for the previous light (kitchen) that was changed, and not the true colour of dining room light.
I first noticed this when I switched all my lights to zigbee via conbee rather then hue bridge.
Additional Information
I know there have recently been some other bugs with Deconz lights, such as transitions to off not working and the lights not reporting their colour state. The second issue (colour state reporting) could be related to this maybe? Just thought I should mention it!

Thanks for reporting! This is fixed in 0.73
It was a combination of component not being fully updated to use the new common base of Hue and saturation that HASS is employing as well as not taking in to consideration that sometimes xy values reported from lights would not be normalised.
You can try it out already now with the 0.73 beta, if you'd like.

I think the old get_config_value is the reason for slow zwave reports. They can run into recursive loop inside async loop and that is very bad. This solution fix that. What I not know if, should we have a global solution or put that only in this component

I don't think that was the reason. It would happen only if zwave is updating the dict at the same time. This should be rare.

We should go the same route as with the input_boolean and the other input components. If initial is missing then use restore.

```
Author:

```
Text:

I have considered that, however with the counter component initial is used for resets as well, which is probably why it has a default value. In my opinion it makes sense to have both an initial state and an option to override it upon start for this component.
I do appreciate that the current default behaviour goes against the other components where initial is always used during startup, so I'm open to suggestions here.

Is it possible this is still an issue?
I think it was working no my hassio install on a raspberry pi.
Today I switched to hassio on ubuntu server with this:
https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/installation/#alternative-install-on-generic-linux-server
When I restart hassio from the webinterface my counter will be reset to 0.
My counter:
counter:
  my_counter:
    step: 1
    restore: true

I have enabled the recorder component.
I also can see the last value from the counter in the entity card but it still will always come up with 0 as wrong value.
EDIT:
Nevermind.
My database got corrupted.
Had to delete the old one, created a new one and than everything works fine.

        Modify pushover notify to support attachments
      
```
Author:

Text:

This change removes the dependency on python-pushover since it does not yet support attachments and the Pushover API can be accessed simply using python requests.  I used the 'load_file' function from slack.py as the basis for the work in this module to keep things consistent.
This implements the feature request found here: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/pushing-images-with-pushover-3-0/40667
The documentation has been updated with an example (6329a89 - Add example file attachment parameters #5134)

python-pushover has support for attachments. It wasn't release yet but there is an open issue for that.
This change seems to simply move the functionality of python-pushover into Home Assistant. Removing python-pushover as a requirement is not the solution for the problem at hand. We don't want to ship protocol-, service- or device-specific code if there is a module available. If the code lives in Home Assistant third parties can't use it and it increases maintenance for all (we need to maintain it in Home Assistant and python-pushover need to do the same work).
The way to proceed will be bump python-pushover to 0.4 and update the pushover platform.

```

Text:

Ok, thanks for the feedback.  I can certainly understand that point of view, but figured since the API is so simple (requests.post(PUSHOVER_API_URL, data=data, files=attachment)), it seemed more productive to incorporate that into Home Assistant and remove the dependency on another project.
So as I understand it, we just put this change on hold and wait for the maintainer of python-pushover to release changes?  The changes were committed over two months ago but I don't see a 0.4 release yet.
I can start preparing for that, as it looks like my code won't change much since they didn't fully implement the image sending by url component, so I would still need to handle downloading, verifying, and clean-up of that as well as checking the validity/accessibility of local images.

```

Working with APIs can be simple...We try to move code out of Home Assistant for platform because if it's a module more people can profit from it, features can be added/tested there first, etc. It doesn't not  matter how simple the code. it's also easier to move a module to asyncio when you only have to deal with one building block.

So as I understand it, we just put this change on hold and wait for the maintainer of python-pushover to release changes? The changes were committed over two months ago but I don't see a 0.4 release yet.

The developer of python-pushover could be busy. Often it helps to get in touch with people outside of GitHub because most are flooded with notifications. As a last resort, if the developer is non-responsive, there is forking.

I can start preparing for that, as it looks like my code won't change much since they didn't fully implement the image sending by url component, so I would still need to handle downloading, verifying, and clean-up of that as well as checking the validity/accessibility of local images.

Again, it helps to improve the module then the code should go upstream.

Why are you storing the file in temp and reloading it?  This way didn't work for me, I just modified what you had to return the image data.
I changed this tofile = self.load_file(...)which now returns req.content instead of filename.
This would not work for me otherwise and it took me forever to figure out why.  I think my file permissions were not working with the temp file.  Plus it seems redundant to save it to a disk or ram just to load it again.
I'm still trying to make the changes for local files, but I apparently can't find a path that is allowed.
